# streamlit_cryptocurrency_app

I have recently been thinking of ways to invest my savings as i feel leaving it in the bank would not be a wise idea due to the effect of inflation. Investing in cryptocurrencies seemed the right way to go however, i needed a way to know which cryptocurrecy to invest in. My criteria for investment in a cryptocurrency include:
- Relatively cheap
- On an upward trajectory
- Profitable in the long run

It is for this reason i decided to create a streamlit app as a side project in order to help visualize cryptocurrency charts
